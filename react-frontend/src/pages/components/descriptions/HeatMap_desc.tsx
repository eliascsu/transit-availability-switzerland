            people live and where they commute to. In a sense, Switzerland is a sprawling country,
            as 50% of the population lives in villages with less than 10'000 inhabitants. However,
            the majority of the population lives in the urban centers of Zurich, Geneva, Basel, Bern,
            and Lausanne. The population density map shows how the population is distributed across
            Switzerland. The map is based on census data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office.
